# Ask Adam Anything

## Why I Built This App
I get a lot of questions and I don't always have time to answer them. I built this little app to provide people with an answer to any question they might have.

## How To Use It
1.  Think of a question
1.  Go to [http://adamruf.com/ask-adam-8-ball/](http://adamruf.com/ask-adam-8-ball/)
1.  Ask your question, then click on cartoon Adam(1)
1.  Repeat until you're either satisfied with the response or run out of questions

(1) designed by my amazing colleague, Charlene Sirianni
